# Java Shortest Path Algorithm

#### About
This application contains three algorithms. Given a matrix with obstacles and a start and end location, the application calculates the length of the shortest path, the amount of obstacle clusters and the size of the largest obstacle cluster.

The user has to configure the size of the matrix. The user can either specify the starting location, the ending location and the locations of the obstacles, or randomly generate those locations.
